# Challenges

Given array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some of its k consecutive elements.

Example

For inputArray = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6] and k = 2, the output should be
arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k) = 8.
All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:

2 + 3 = 5;
3 + 5 = 8;
5 + 1 = 6;
1 + 6 = 7.
Thus, the answer is 8.

```

def arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inp, k):

    y=[sum(inp[i:(k)+i]) for i in range(len(inp)-1)]
    return(max(y))
    
    


```
